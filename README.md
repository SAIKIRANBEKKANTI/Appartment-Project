# Appartment-Project

created ASP.NET CORE 3.1 MVC APPLICATION

At first we will see the Registration page after successfull Registration 

We can find tables like ApartmentResidents,ExpenceTracting,ExpenseCategories,Registration,tags and users

Next I have created API Controller for my ExpenceCategories and created Attribute Routing name Exp for that 

Next I have created swagger and enabled it
